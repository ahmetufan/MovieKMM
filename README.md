# Built With  :hammer_and_wrench:

‚Ä¢	[Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) - A framework that allows for sharing a common codebase across Android and iOS platforms. This significantly reduces the need to write redundant code for both platforms.<br/>
‚Ä¢	[Kotlin Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - Kotlin Jetpack Compose is a declarative UI framework used to build Android application interfaces.<br/>
‚Ä¢	[MVI (Model-View-Intent)](https://medium.com/swlh/mvi-architecture-with-android-fcde123e3c4a) -  A contemporary UI design pattern. It assists in centrally managing the application's state and updating the UI accordingly.<br/>
‚Ä¢	[Kotlinx Serialization](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/serialization.html) - Used for converting JSON data into Kotlin objects and vice versa. This simplifies working with API responses.<br/>
‚Ä¢	[Ktor](https://ktor.io/) - Used for HTTP communication on both the server and client side. For this project, it was employed to create HTTP client functions that work with KMM on both iOS and Android.<br/>
‚Ä¢	[Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines?hl=tr) - Utilized for concurrency and asynchronous programming needs. It allows handling asynchronous tasks, like network requests or long-running operations, in a simple and readable manner.<br/>
‚Ä¢	[Koin](https://insert-koin.io/docs/quickstart/android/) -  A lightweight framework for dependency injection. It makes your code more modular and testable.<br/>
‚Ä¢	[ViewModel]([https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel)) - Used to manage and store application data. It helps in preserving data across configuration changes such as screen rotations.<br/>
‚Ä¢	[Lazy Column](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/lists) - Used to display the dashboard<br/> 
‚Ä¢	[Material Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) - Material design components like ripple animation, cardView.<br/>
